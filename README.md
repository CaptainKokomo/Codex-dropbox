# NodeLab

NodeLab is a tactile electronics sandbox built with Electron and React. It combines a snap-grid canvas, live simulation feedback, and plain-English coaching so beginners can assemble their first blinking LED circuit in under a minute.

## Download & install

End users never have to touch Node.js or command lines. Each release ships with two ready-to-run Windows executables:

1. **`NodeLab-Setup.exe`** – one-click installer that adds a desktop shortcut and Start menu entry.
2. **`NodeLab.exe`** – portable build you can run from any folder or USB drive.

Grab them from the `release/` folder generated by `npm run release:win` (or from the project’s release page), double-click, and you’re in. No extra runtimes, no arcane installers.

## Build from source (for contributors)

> **Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+ and npm 9+.

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development environment (launches Vite and Electron in parallel):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build renderer and main bundles:

```bash
npm run build
```

Create distributables (`NodeLab-Setup.exe` installer + portable build):

```bash
npm run dist
```

Generate the Windows-ready binaries with the exact filenames end users expect:

```bash
npm run release:win
```

The command above outputs `release/NodeLab-Setup.exe` and `release/NodeLab.exe`.

## Key features in this iteration

- **Snap-grid canvas with drag-to-wire interactions.** Components highlight their labeled terminals (+, −, OUT, etc.) and wires glow when selected.
- **Component customization through the inspector.** Adjust values with sliders (resistor, LED, battery, etc.), rotate parts in advanced mode, and mark custom tweaks.
- **Gamified questline.** Quest tracker guides learners through the Blink Party mission, awarding rewards without “micro lesson” jargon.
- **Friendly diagnostics.** Real-time hints explain missing power, absent resistors, and possible shorts in plain English.
- **Instrumentation strip.** Multimeter, oscilloscope frequency readout, and coaching feed provide live feedback.
- **Settings modal.** Toggle language tone, tips, auto-update, advanced sandbox, and choose the default project folder.
- **Kits & prefabs.** Palette lists component kits for planning and prefab circuits for instant blinking fun.

## Architecture notes

- **State management:** Zustand with immer middleware powers global state. Selectors expose the active project and selection.
- **Simulation stub:** `renderer/src/utils/simulation.ts` currently estimates voltages/currents and diagnostics; it is ready to be swapped with a physics-accurate solver.
- **IPC bridge:** `electron/preload.ts` exposes safe APIs for file dialogs, settings persistence (via `electron-store`), and exports.
- **Packaging:** `electron-builder.json5` creates both NSIS installer (`NodeLab-Setup.exe`) and portable (`NodeLab.exe`) artifacts.
