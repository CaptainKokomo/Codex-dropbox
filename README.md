# NodeLab â€“ Stage 0 (First-Run Wizard)

This checkpoint delivers the first-run wizard experience for NodeLab. The app greets new makers with a simple, installer-friendly flow:

- **Welcome** screen that sets expectations without technical jargon.
- **Save folder selection** using the native Windows folder picker (no command line needed).
- **Auto-update toggle** so users stay in control while remaining fully offline.
- **10-second guided tour** that orients the user to the virtual workbench.
- **Local telemetry sandbox** capturing only on-device step completion for future replay features.

Subsequent launches skip the wizard while preserving the option to reset it from Settings (to be added in upcoming stages).

> ğŸš§ Future stages will stand up the breadboard bench, wiring interactions, tutorials, and simulation engine.
