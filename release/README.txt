This folder stores the prebuilt Windows executables that ship with NodeLab distributions:

- NodeLab-Setup.exe — the installer build.
- NodeLab.exe — the portable build.

They are distributed through the release ZIP so that users never have to touch a command line. If you are looking at the source tree and these files are missing, download the packaged release bundle.
